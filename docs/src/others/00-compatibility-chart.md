# Compatibility Chart

Hatsu is primarily geared towards the micro-blogging platform in the Fediverse.

Currently I've created a chart for all the platforms I expect to be compatible with, and hopefully it will be filled in later:

|            | [Follow] |     |
| ---------- | ------ | --- |
| Mastodon   | ✅     |     |
| GoToSocial |        |     |
| Misskey    |        |     |
| Pleroma    |        |     |

<!-- After a period of time: if you wish to support the new platform, you can open a new discussion. -->
