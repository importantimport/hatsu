# Getting Started

## Setting up your static site

Once you register in Hatsu instance, it will be updated **fully automatically**.

However, your site will need to make some changes accordingly to take advantage of the ActivityPub features that Hatsu brings to the table.

- [Feed](./feed.md)
- [Redirecting](./redirecting.md)
- [Backfeed](./backfeed.md)

## Choose instance

After Hatsu supports public instances, there may be a list of instances here.

Until then, you'll need to [self-host the instance](../admins/install-with-docker.md) or find an person running a Hatsu instance and have them create an account.
